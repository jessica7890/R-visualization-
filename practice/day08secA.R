##(2) Data Exploration and Cleaning

str(tennis)
## Too many variables, focus on a few
ts <- select(tennis, tourney_id:surface, tourney_date, 
             match_num, winner_id,
             winner_name, winner_hand,winner_age,
             loser_id,loser_name, loser_hand,loser_age,
             minutes,winner_rank,winner_rank_points,
             loser_rank,loser_rank_points)

select(tennis,-tourney_id:-loser_rank)
##(3) Create an indicator column, specifying whether the
## game is an upset. (A person with a higher rank
## lose the same)
ts_new <- mutate(ts,upset=1*((winner_rank-loser_rank)>0))
ts_new[,18:19]
head(ts_new)
ts_new_s <- select(ts_new,-tourney_id:-minutes)
head(ts_new_s,6)
#How many upset matches do I have?
summarise(ts_new_s,sum(upset))
summarise(ts_new_s,sum(upset,na.rm=TRUE))
#na.rm: remove the missing values in calculation.

##(4) What if I want to count how many games each player win?
head(ts)
ts_win_grouped <- group_by(ts,winner_name)
ts_win_grouped
ts_win <- summarise(ts_win_grouped,n_win=n())
ts_win
##(5) Who had the most number of wins? Reorder data
ts_win <- arrange(ts_win,desc(n_win))
head(ts_win)


##(6) Let's calculate the average total time of a game, and the number
##of games that the player who has the most number of wins. had on different surface.
winfirst <- filter(ts,winner_name=="James Duckworth"|loser_name=="James Duckworth")
winfirst_grouped <- group_by(winfirst,surface)
summarise(winfirst_grouped,ave_minutes=mean(minutes),n_game=n())



##(7) What if I want to automate the process (4), (5), (6)
##for other years of data, without need to run the code separately
##short cut for %>% : "ctrl"+"shift"+"M"
##a. find the player
ts %>% group_by(winner_name) %>% 
  summarise(n_win=n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n_win)) %>% 
  top_n(1,n_win) %>% 
  select(1,1)

#top_n(x, n, wt), x is the data, n is the number of 
#rows to return, wt is the variable to use for ordering.
#if not specified, defaults to the last variable in x.

##b. do the computation
#paste0: Concatenate vectors after converting to character.
#paste0(player_selected,collapse = ", ")

#--------------------------------------------------
#(1) Preparing the data

##Your Turn##
### Manipulation of the BRFSS data:
# 0. Take a look at code book for the PYSHLTH and MENTHLTH variables, page 17 and 18.
# 1. Narrow down to a small number of columns, {IMONTH IDAY PHYSHLTH MENTHLTH}.
# 2. Convert the "None" for Phyiscal and Mental health issues to 0 days.
# 3. Keep only complete records for values for health responses (drop "missing", "don't know",etc.).
# 4. Display the first 6 lines of the final data.
#%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

#Hint for task 2.
#ifelse(test, yes, no)
#$test:an object which can be coerced to logical mode.
#yes:return values for true elements of test.
#no:return values for false elements of test.
